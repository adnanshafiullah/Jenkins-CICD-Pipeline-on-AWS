We will crate a CI/CD pipeline on AWS step by step.We haev created this on a local computer but in realtime environment
we need to work on public cloud like AWS so that is why I'm creating this lab.

I have used "Solarwinds Putty" in this lab to conenct to the ec2 instances.You can use Putty as well.
