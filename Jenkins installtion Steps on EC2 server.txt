First of all I will update the Master,Staging & Production server and install the Jenkins on the Master Server only.
To do so follow the below commands:

1.sudo apt-get update (run on all servers)
2.sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk (run on all servrs to install Java)

Now we will download the jenkins package on the Master server:
(https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins+on+Ubuntu)

3.wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins-ci.org.key | sudo apt-key add -

Now to cache the repository into the sources of the operating system
4.sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'

Now update the server again:
5.sudo apt-get update

Now isntall Jenkins:

6. sudo apt-get install jenkins

Start Jenkins on the Master server & check status after that:

7. sudo systemctl start jenkins
   sudo systemctl status jenkins

Now we will use the public IP address of the Master server to launch the Jenkins on a browser. Incase you see any error it means
you will have to open the port 8080 to let traffic pass through. go to the security group of your master server and edit/modify
the inbound rule (example: allow 'custome tcp rule', port '8080',source= any 0.0.0./0)then you'll be able to see jenkins working
on a web browser.

Now you will see a message on the browser to unlock the jenkins. just copy the path and cat it on the server to get the 
secret password. once you have the password , put it on the web browser and continue.
