Once you have created the user name & password go with the 'Install Suggested Plugins". Once installtion finihsed then
start adding nodes (slave-1 & slave-2 servers) on the Master Server.See the diagram (Ref: Jenkins Node)

To add nodes we will follow jnlp protocol and in order to do so we will have to open the port on the master server so that
it can communicate with the other servers (slave-1/slave-2). We can modify or add the security group only specific to the
IP address or security group so that they can talk to each other.

To add the slave-1/slave-2 servers as nodes to the Master server follow the below steps:

Go to > Configure GLobal Security> Under Agent>'TCP port for inbound agents'> select 'Random'

Go to > Configure GLobal Security> Manage Nodes> click 'New Node'> name it as 'slave-1'click Permanent agent >
      > Assign value to 'Remote root directory'=/home/ubuntu/jenkins
      > Launch method= select launch agnet by conenting it to the master
      > click save
      >click on 'New Node'>type slave-2 in the node name field>select 'copy existing node' to copy the settings
       then assign value & other settings as we did for the slave-1

Now follow the steps below to connect these nodes (slave-1/slave-2) to the master server as below:

1. First click on the slave-1 node and once you are into this node you will see a command which will needed
to be run on the master server. you'll need two files i. slave-agent.jnlp ii.agent.jar. Now click on the 'Launch'
which will download the slave-agent.jnlp file and after that click on the 'agent.jar' to download. 
So now these two files has to be present into the staging server.

2. We will use filezilla (or mobiextream clinet app) to copy these file to the staging server.Put the staging server's public IP into the 'Host'
and put 'ubuntu' to the username section. There is no password here, instead click on the 'edit'>settings>SFTP>add key file>
then add the ppk for this server and you should be able to log into this server. Once you are logged in then simply drag and drop
those two files (i. slave-agent.jnlp ii.agent.jar) and you are all set.

3.Now go to your slave-1 server and check these copied files.in case you need to rename these files, simply use mv command to rename
as needed.You can now copy the command from the stagin node and run it into the staging server.If all goes ok then you'll see connected
into the terminal of your staging server and into the Jenkins you will see this staging node is conencted.

4. Do the same steps for the slave-2 node as above.

5.Both nodes are now conencted to the Master servers.
